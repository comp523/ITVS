# Project Introduction

The goal of this project is to streamline the process by which employees of the Lineberger Cancer Center document and classify Internet Tobacco Vendors. Initially, we will start with tracking Reddit popularity of certain keywords and interests with the goal of providing insight about how these communities and interests have changed over time. We plan to then expand the project to provide a predictive analysis tool on websites with ambiguous internet tobacco vendor status, to aid employees in pruning false positives. 

**Tweet:** Our aim is to provide utilities aiding in the process of scraping, caching, and identifying internet tobacco vending websites.
