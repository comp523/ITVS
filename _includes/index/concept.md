# Project Concept

This project is intended to enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of the Internet Tobacco Vendors Study (ITVS).
To provide such an enhancement, our team will focus on two main goals: automating and streamlining much of the ITVS’s
research process;namely the processes scraping, caching, and identifying internet tobacco vendors, and providing an
intuitive mechanism for up-to-date social media stats, specifically information about particular Sub-Reddits.

The current process of identifying internet tobacco vendors is a tedious and repetitive process involving manually
visiting over ten thousand websites, to determine whether they are actual vendors, or false positives. To improve the
efficiency of this process, we will implement an automated website analyzer to aid in determining the site’s tobacco
vending status. An effective analyzer can be implemented by identifying various features indicative of internet
tobacco vendors, and utilizing a simple classifier to provide a self-improving tool that produces a confidence level
with its prediction.

Currently, the ITVS only accounts for statically served tobacco vendors. We will improve the breadth of the study
by creating a flexible and easy-to-use data collection tool for the online E-Cigarette community on Reddit. Our tool
will maintain an up-to-date database of specific information regarding posts in the various Sub-Reddits of this
community, e.g. post title, number of up/down votes, number of comments, etc. This data can be used to track and
analyze trends in the E-Cigarette community.

Our stretch goals for this project involve providing scripts and services to automate and streamline various other
parts of the ITVS research and data collection process. Potential areas for improvement include: creating scripts
to transform data effectively between formats conducive to manual labor and automation.
