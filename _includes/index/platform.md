# Platform Analysis and Selection

### Programming Language/Libraries

**[Python 3](https://docs.python.org/3/):** Selected over Python 2 due to nearing end-of-life of Python 2.

**Machine Learning Library:** *[scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/)* and *[TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/)* are potential candidates under review.

### Code Quality Assurance

**[PyUnit](https://docs.python.org/3.5/library/unittest.html)/[nosetests](http://nose.readthedocs.io/en/latest/):** Reduce bug severity with test-driven development.  
**[Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/):** Continuous integration, namely automated unit testing.  
**[CodeClimate](https://codeclimate.com/):** Ensure style-guide adherence and best coding practices.  
**Manual Code Review:** All code is peer-reviewed prior to incorporation.
